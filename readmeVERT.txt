These codes were written by Borko Bulajic.

There are four files.
1. regressionBB2020vert.m provides necessary function for the main code file.
2. RegressPGAvert.m is the main code file to get results of multiple linear regression for estimating scaling coefficients for the vertical PGA values.
3. MRSGSLdata.mat provides the first part of the exemplary input data - magnitudes, source to site distances, and geology conditions.
4. VertPGAdata.mat provides the second part of the exemplary input data - PGA values recorded in vertical direction.

The needed MATLAB version is at least 8.5 release 2015a.
